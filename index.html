<h2 id="child-friendly">Child Friendly</h2>
<pre><code>* Backseat Generation
	* The Island Archipelago Idea (Children thought of the city as islands and never got to experince it in the backseat)
	* Less physical avtivitey of children on average (80 percent of american kids and 93 percent of canaadian kids dont get the recommedned hours of physcial activities
* More independence for children (less management and work for parents)
* Better performance during the school day if the child walked or biked to school
&gt; It concluded that kids who cycled or walked to school, rather than being bussed or driven, performed better on tasks that required concentration—such as solving puzzles—and these effects lasted for up to four hours after they arrived. (Curbing Traffic 17)
* Protecting kids **too** much from things and heavily suprivising them can lead to bad coping mechanism for adversity in the future
&gt; “Dealing with risk is no longer seen as a part of growing up,” (laments Karsten)
* Long commutes to school have negative affects on children especailly on the amount of physical activity and sleep a child gets 
&gt; 2017 paper published in the Journal of Planning Education and Research

* by pushing traffic around the city, kids can freely go to school, a local shop,  or a friends house.
* Veer Types of Wegens in Delft
	* Stroomwegen (Flow Roads)—motorways limited to 100 km/h or 
</code></pre>
<p>60 mph<br>
* Gebiedsontsluitingswegen (Distributor Roads)—arterials limited to 50 km/h or 30 mph within built-up areas<br>
* Erftoegangswegen (Access Roads)—30 km/h or 20 mph residential streets<br>
* Wijkontsluitingsweg (District Access Road)—40 km/h (25 mph)<br>
* Having multiple options of transport for different situations (such as a quick stop to the groceries store) reduces the amount of cars on the road which in turn reduces congestion and allows for faster long trips. Moving traffic from slower access roads to faster distributor roads that go around the city ensures people can roam inside the city peaceful with slow, low volumes of traffic. Access Roads meaning places where pople walk and talk and buy groceries, and where residents live.</p>

<h2 id="connected-meaning-people-are-more-social">Connected meaning people are more social</h2>
<pre><code>* Streets used to be meant for people to stay in but are now a way to pass though. The more cars go though a street, the worse the social environment is on that street.
* Engineers use the satisfaction of drivers as a way to determine if the street design is a success or a failure.
* There's a study condutcted that had 3 catagores of streets (p.34)
	* Light (2,000 vehicles per day at 30 km/h or 20 mph)
	* Moderate (8,000 vehicles per day at 40 km/h or 25 mph)
	* Heavy (16,000 vehicles per day at 60 km/h or 35 mph)
* the residents of each type of street were asked questions about the safety, comfort level, and there social environment. The result was fear and distrust between strangers 
* The results indicated that the people living in the light catagory reported 3 times more local friends and 2 times more local aquantences then people living on the heavy street.twee
&gt;Bruce Appleyard - Livable Streets 2.0

* Due to unfriendliness, feelings distrust and fear between strangers appeared much more often
* The internet caused places like the bookstore, video-store, news-stand, post office to become mostly obsolete. Places were you might meet people you can comfortably socialize with
* Coorelation between personal relationships and compassion, empathy, and cooperation from an early age
&gt; In 2014, 23 percent of  Americans reported not having anyone to regularly converse with, up from 8 percent in 1985. 

* Though change like moving living quarters, new schools, starting carriers, leaving family social circles often diminish.
&gt; "As Pinker writes on page 21, “The right kind of social contact—a.k.a. not hostile—instructs the body to secrete more endogenous opiates, which act as local painkillers, and fewer hormones such as adrenaline, nor￾adrenaline and corticosteroids—the body’s often destructive answer to immediate stressors.” (Aurthor of The Village Effect) (p.40)

* this isolation manifests itself in a variety of unexpected ways. People 
</code></pre>
<p>living alone are generally more vigilant, fearful, unable to relax, and<br>
more likely to awaken often in the night. (p.39)<br>
&gt; A 2007 study by Dr. Steve Cole found that the genes that regulate<br>
a person’s immune response to cancer are “switched on” when they<br>
connect to another person socially. This therapeutic effect goes beyond<br>
the body’s response to serious health issues, such as tumor growth. (p.40)</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Through her research, Pinker found regular interaction with close personal relationships increases one’s life expectancy by an average of 15 years. So it should come as no surprise that lonely people are more likely to experience serious health issues and premature death than their socially connected counterparts. A 2020 report from the National Academies of Sciences found that isolation was associated with a significantly increased risk of premature mortality from all causes, including dementia, coronary heart disease, cancer, fu semi-private nctional decline, and stroke. (p.41)

* Woonerf (living street) has a formal distinct entry way, cars slowed to 15km/h en pedestrians were given the full width of de straat. there work as resident socializing, child play areas and act as a semi-private front yard to residents, strict rules on cars
Example:
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/GMSsBZr/woonerf-entrance-example.png" alt="woonerf-entrance_example"><br>
&gt; (p.43)(MUST CITE)</p>
<pre><code>&gt; The introduction of a winding pathway disrupts the driver’s sightline, discouraging drivers from looking too far ahead and racing through.(p.43)

This is for slowing drivers down especially in woonerfs
* woonerf was too expensive to implement in the nederlands so an alternative standard the Erftoegangswegen (access road) for residentatil streets
&gt; 1992 Sustainable Safety policy (p.45)

* Another byproduct of the woonerf was de geveltuin (facade garden) they need to preserve the width of the road but residents are encourged to remove a brick in front of there home and replace with a little garden and maybe some seating. this creates some of the feeling of a woonerf but without the financail strain on the dutch goverment like the woonerf did.

<h2 id="trusting-city">Trusting City</h2>
<pre><code> * Major fietstraten don't usually have lights. like the one in delft that has 21,000 cyclist per weekday
 &gt; this one successfully (and safely) functions without a single paint mark, road sign, or traffic light (p.49)

street crossing at Abtswoudseweg and Zuideinde in delft

* Most trips in delft are made by foot or by bike, socail interatctions and trust are ideal to control the flow of traffic. (maybe dual processing in order for someone to understand social cues, research paper or papers needed)
An Example:
&gt; when an approaching cyclist stops moving their feet, they are preparing to turn by applying their pedal-brake. (p.50)
 
 Another Example would be the braking system of "dutch bicycles". Much like child bicycles in america (at least what i know so far, must do more research), when you pedal in the opposite direction it brakes for you. This can be used to determine if someone is stopping or possibly slowing down to turn. 
 *  While generally rare, there are misjudgments that may result in close calls or fender benders but nothing like a car accidents. An Apology or a head nod/wave to the affronted party and everyone goes there separate ways.
 * The 'dutch bicycle' has een upward sitting position not meant to be aerodynamic but meant for comfort and continuous engagement of ones senses
 * The average speed 10-15 km/h (6-10 mph) is good for expressing body language and to receive signals from others as well.
 * People trust each other to act predictably using body language, bell ringing, or even words. This results in a flow that allows cyclist to stop fewer times then would be necessary with lights. Momentum is the cyclist greatest asset and these streets allow for this asset to be utilized to the fullest.
 &gt; "For Chris’s new daily 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) commute to the office, he pedals through 20 different (three- or four-legged) intersections" (p.52-53) he only 3 traffic lights and no stop signs

* Mellisa Says this about the dutch and trusting they are may be 
&gt; "at least in part—because of the way so many of them traveled around their cities, in constant communication with each other, building common empathy, acceptance, and understanding at an enormous scale"

&gt; Dr. Marco te Brömmelstroet, professor of urban mobility futures at the University of Amsterdam...the homo economicus (economic man) theory...make consistently rational, narrowly self-interested choices, to maximize their utility as a consumer and profit as a producer. (p.54) Refer to the PAGE FOR MORE DETAILS.

* though the homo economicus idea came with the idea of effeciancy on the road. Everything from speed to congestion was kept to a minimum and with the invention of commercial cars, roads were paved, and driving was seen as the ultimate modal for efficiency, which in turn made them better at being a consumer/producer
* Te Brömmelstroet believes that: 
&gt; solitary space of the automobile reinforces feelings of selfishness, distrust, and a lack of cooperation with others.

*  that technology governing the interactions between people (atleast most of the time) made the experience more depersonalized. Its harder to make human signals when your in an enclosed veichle and possibly with tinted windows as well
* Social trust erodes as autombiles become the modal of choice
&gt; World Values Survey (tracks socail trust in different countrys, should check out) (p.55)

* Social trust has been declining is now at 35% in america and 30% in great  Britain while the netherlands is second to only norway which is at 70% which isnt proof but support for more research
* Theres also a change in your biochemistry, humans have evolved to receive a lot of information though eye contact en body language but you cant do that while traveling at high speeds 30 km/h (20mph)
* Oxycontin is released when one orgasms, breastfeeds, eye contact, and when exercising such as walking or bicycling which can be compounded when doing this with other people, can reducing blood sugar 
* cars are  great for the elites and people traveling great distances but limits the right of way of others
* the homo economus theory suggests that one
